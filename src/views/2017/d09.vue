        part1: 'A large stream blocks your path. According to the locals, it\'s not safe to cross the stream at the moment because it\'s full of garbage. You look down at the stream; rather than water, you discover that it\'s a stream of characters.\nYou sit for a while and record part of the stream (your puzzle input). The characters represent groups - sequences that begin with { and end with }. Within a group, there are zero or more other things, separated by commas: either another group or garbage. Since groups can contain other groups, a } only closes the most-recently-opened unclosed group - that is, they are nestable. Your puzzle input represents a single, large group which itself contains many smaller ones.\nSometimes, instead of a group, you will find garbage. Garbage begins with < and ends with >. Between those angle brackets, almost any character can appear, including { and }. Within garbage, < has no special meaning.\nIn a futile attempt to clean up the garbage, some program has canceled some of the characters within it using !: inside garbage, any character that comes after ! should be ignored, including <, >, and even another !.\nYou don\'t see any characters that deviate from these rules. Outside garbage, you only find well-formed groups, and garbage always terminates according to the rules above.\nHere are some self-contained pieces of garbage:\n<>, empty garbage.\n<random characters>, garbage containing random characters.\n<<<<>, because the extra < are ignored.\n<{!>}>, because the first > is canceled.\n<!!>, because the second ! is canceled, allowing the > to terminate the garbage.\n<!!!>>, because the second ! and the first > are canceled.\n<{o"i!a,<{i<a>, which ends at the first >.\nHere are some examples of whole streams and the number of groups they contain:\n{}, 1 group.\n{{{}}}, 3 groups.\n{{},{}}, also 3 groups.\n{{{},{},{{}}}}, 6 groups.\n{<{},{},{{}}>}, 1 group (which itself contains garbage).\n{<a>,<a>,<a>,<a>}, 1 group.\n{{<a>},{<a>},{<a>},{<a>}}, 5 groups.\n{{<!>},{<!>},{<!>},{<a>}}, 2 groups (since all but the last > are canceled).\nYour goal is to find the total score for all groups in your input. Each group is assigned a score which is one more than the score of the group that immediately contains it. (The outermost group gets a score of 1.)\n{}, score of 1.\n{{{}}}, score of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n{{},{}}, score of 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n{{{},{},{{}}}}, score of 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 16.\n{<a>,<a>,<a>,<a>}, score of 1.\n{{<ab>},{<ab>},{<ab>},{<ab>}}, score of 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9.\n{{<!!>},{<!!>},{<!!>},{<!!>}}, score of 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9.\n{{<a!>},{<a!>},{<a!>},{<ab>}}, score of 1 + 2 = 3.\nWhat is the total score for all groups in your input?',
