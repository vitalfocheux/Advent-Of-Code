    <h1>Day 13 - A Maze of Twisty Little Cubicles</h1>
    <h2>Part one</h2>
    <p>
        You arrive at the first floor of this new building to discover a much less welcoming environment than the shiny atrium of the last one. Instead, you are in a maze of twisty little cubicles, all alike.

        Every location in this area is addressed by a pair of non-negative integers (x,y). Each such coordinate is either a wall or an open space. You can't move diagonally. The cube maze starts at 0,0 and seems to extend infinitely toward positive x and y; negative values are invalid, as they represent a location outside the building. You are in a small waiting area at 1,1.

        While it seems chaotic, a nearby morale-boosting poster explains, the layout is actually quite logical. You can determine whether a given x,y coordinate will be a wall or an open space using a simple system:

        Find x*x + 3*x + 2*x*y + y + y*y.
        Add the office designer's favorite number (your puzzle input).
        Find the binary representation of that sum; count the number of bits that are 1.
        If the number of bits that are 1 is even, it's an open space.
        If the number of bits that are 1 is odd, it's a wall.
        For example, if the office designer's favorite number were 10, drawing walls as # and open spaces as ., the corner of the building containing 0,0 would look like this:

        0123456789
        0 .#.####.##
        1 ..#..#...#
        2 #....##...
        3 ###.#.###.
        4 .##..#..#.
        5 ..##....#.
        6 #...##.###
        Now, suppose you wanted to reach 7,4. The shortest route you could take is marked as O:

        0123456789
        0 .#.####.##
        1 .O#..#...#
        2 #OOO.##...
        3 ###O#.###.
        4 .##OO#OO#.
        5 ..##OOO.#.
        6 #...##.###
        Thus, reaching 7,4 would take a minimum of 11 steps (starting from your current location, 1,1).

        What is the fewest number of steps required for you to reach 31,39?
